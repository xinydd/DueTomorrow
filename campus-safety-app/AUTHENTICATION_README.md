  - `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
  - `POST /auth/profile` - Get user profile

### Frontend Architecture
- **Authentication Service**: `src/services/authService.js`
- **Security Context**: `src/state/SecurityContext.jsx`
- **Protected Routes**: `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`
- **Role-based Navigation**: `src/components/RoleBasedNavigation.jsx`

### State Management
- User authentication state
- Role-based permissions
- JWT token management
- Local storage persistence

## Usage

### Signup Process
1. User fills out signup form with name, email, password
2. User selects role (Student, Staff, or Security)
3. Form validates input and sends to backend
4. Backend creates user and returns JWT token
5. User is automatically logged in and redirected

### Login Process
1. User enters email and password
2. Backend validates credentials
3. Returns JWT token with user data and role
4. User is redirected to role-appropriate dashboard

### Role-based Access
- **Students**: See SOS button and safety features
- **Staff**: See reports dashboard and guardian features
- **Security**: See alerts dashboard and emergency management

## Security Features
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based route protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure password handling
- Token expiration handling

## UI/UX Features
- Consistent theming across all auth pages
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Loading states and error handling
- Role-based navigation and content
- User-friendly error messages

## Testing
To test the authentication system:

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server**:
   ```bash
   cd campus-safety-app
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test different roles**:
   - Sign up as a Student and test SOS features
   - Sign up as Staff and test report viewing
   - Sign up as Security and test alert management

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Create new user account
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate user
- `POST /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile

### Role-based Endpoints
